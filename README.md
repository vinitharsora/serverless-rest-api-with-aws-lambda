In this article, Iâ€™ll be making use of the **Serverless Framework** to build and deploy a simple **Node.js API to Lambda and API Gateway**. Our data will be stored using **Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for PostgreSQL.**

# Objective

1. Developing a Serverless framework based application using Node.js to build and deploy it to AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway.
2. Backing up the application with an Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for PostgreSQL,using pgAdmin for creation of database and table with the required columns.
3. Fully verifying the implemented REST APIs using Postman running the application on the localhost server on current machine, later migrated the deployment completely on the AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway services.
